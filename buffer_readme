Idea : 

Rather than giving root permissions we can elevate their privilege to some level ! not exactly root ! 
all users have to do is set the correct setreuid in the assembly code!!
so that the desired (restricted)folder can be accessed ! 

error: root euid and ruid is 0 ! so they might directly input 0 ....

solution:what we can do is change change euid and ruid of root to some other random value so that  its impossible for them to guess !

We can give them hints about the set euid and ruid of the restricted file !!!!
